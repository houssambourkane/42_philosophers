# Philosophers
This project is a training to multi-threading and multi-process programming with the help of mutexes and semaphores.
The goal is to simulate a twist of the famous Dining Philosophers problem (rules are mentioned below).
It is also a good practice in C optimization as we need to save every CPU usage so that we can ensure the survival of the philosophers
This project is also a good lesson in C optimization as we need to save every bit of CPU usage we can to ensure the survival of our philosophers.

#### Mandatory part: using threads and mutexes
#### Bonus part: using processes and semaphores

## Overview
```
One or more philosophers sit at a round table.
There is a large bowl of spaghetti in the middle of the table.
• The philosophers alternatively eat, think, or sleep.
While they are eating, they are not thinking nor sleeping;
while thinking, they are not eating nor sleeping;
and, of course, while sleeping, they are not eating nor thinking.
• There are also forks on the table. There are as many forks as philosophers.
• Because serving and eating spaghetti with only one fork is very inconvenient, a
philosopher takes their right and their left forks to eat, one in each hand.
• When a philosopher has finished eating, they put their forks back on the table and
start sleeping. Once awake, they start thinking again. The simulation stops when
a philosopher dies of starvation.
• Every philosopher needs to eat and should never starve.
• Philosophers don’t speak with each other.
• Philosophers don’t know if another philosopher is about to die.
• No need to say that philosophers should avoid dying!
```
## Global rules :
```
• Global variables are forbidden!
• Your(s) program(s) should take the following arguments:
number_of_philosophers time_to_die time_to_eat time_to_sleep
[number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat]
◦ number_of_philosophers: The number of philosophers and also the number
of forks.
◦ time_to_die (in milliseconds): If a philosopher didn’t start eating time_to_die
milliseconds since the beginning of their last meal or the beginning of the simulation, they die.
◦ time_to_eat (in milliseconds): The time it takes for a philosopher to eat.
During that time, they will need to hold two forks.
◦ time_to_sleep (in milliseconds): The time a philosopher will spend sleeping.
◦ number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat (optional argument): If all
philosophers have eaten at least number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat
times, the simulation stops. If not specified, the simulation stops when a
philosopher dies.
• Each philosopher has a number ranging from 1 to number_of_philosophers.
• Philosopher number 1 sits next to philosopher number number_of_philosophers.
Any other philosopher number N sits between philosopher number N - 1 and philosopher number N + 1.
About the logs of your program:
• Any state change of a philosopher must be formatted as follows:
◦ timestamp_in_ms X has taken a fork
◦ timestamp_in_ms X is eating
◦ timestamp_in_ms X is sleeping
◦ timestamp_in_ms X is thinking
◦ timestamp_in_ms X died
Replace timestamp_in_ms with the current timestamp in milliseconds
and X with the philosopher number.
• A displayed state message should not be mixed up with another message.
• A message announcing a philosopher died should be displayed no more than 10 ms
after the actual death of the philosopher.
• Again, philosophers should avoid dying!
```
## Mandatory part
```
• Each philosopher should be a thread.
• There is one fork between each pair of philosophers. Therefore, if there are several
philosophers, each philosopher has a fork on their left side and a fork on their right
side. If there is only one philosopher, there should be only one fork on the table.
• To prevent philosophers from duplicating forks, you should protect the forks state
with a mutex for each of them.
```
## Bonus Part
```
• All the forks are put in the middle of the table.
• They have no states in memory but the number of available forks is represented by
a semaphore.
• Each philosopher should be a process. But the main process should not be a
philosopher.
